# Experiment 5
## Aim
To learn the execution and use of if statements & switch in c++.

## Software Used
VS Code

## Problem Statements
1. Leap Year Checker: Create a C++ program to determine if a given year is a leap year.
2. Password Validator: Write a C++ program to validate passwords based on specific criteria.
3. Days of the Week Printer: Implement a C++ program that outputs the days of the week based on user input.
4. Simple Calculator: Develop a C++ program that performs basic arithmetic operations.
5. Grade Evaluator: Build a C++ program to evaluate and display grades based on student scores.

## Theory
If Statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition evaluates to true.
Else Statement: Executes an alternative block of code if the condition in the if statement is false.
Else if Statement: Tests additional conditions if previous conditions are false.
Switch Statement: Executes different blocks of code based on the value of a given expression. It allows for multiple execution paths and is useful when handling various cases based on a variable's value. The switch expression must be of type int or char.
## Example Usage of switch
The switch statement provides a way to handle multiple possible values for a variable. Each case represents a potential value, and the corresponding block of code executes if the switch expression matches that case value.
